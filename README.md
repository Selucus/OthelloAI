This project splits different features of the system into seperate python files.  
OthelloNEA.py is the main file which provides a main menu for the user.  
OthelloAI.py is loaded when the user chooses to play against the AI and manages the board state and user inputs.  
MiniMax.py contains the heuristic minimax algorithm and the lookup table and is responsible for determining the best move for the AI.
